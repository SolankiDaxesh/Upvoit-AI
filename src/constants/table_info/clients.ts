ðŸ§  BASE RULES FOR SQL GENERATION
==============================

1. Always generate highly optimized SQL queries.
2. Use JOINs with WITH(NOLOCK) on all table references.
3. Use table aliases (e.g., C, CP, CT) to improve readability.
4. Never use SELECT * â€” only select the necessary columns.
5. Use LEFT JOIN by default unless INNER JOIN is explicitly required.
6. Always apply WHERE C.IsDeleted = 0 to filter active clients.
7. If additional WHERE conditions exist, append AND C.IsDeleted = 0.
8. If the user provides a client name, apply the condition:
   (C.FirstName LIKE '%{name}%' OR C.LastName LIKE '%{name}%')
   and combine it with C.IsDeleted = 0.
9. Use ISNULL() or COALESCE() to handle NULLs safely.
10. Avoid unnecessary subqueries and select only relevant rows.
11. Format SQL cleanly and clearly for readability.

**Relationship**: ClientProperties.ClientId â†’ Clients.ClientId  

---

**Table**: ClientContacts  
**Description**: Stores additional contacts related to the client.  
**Columns**:  
- ClientContactId (PK): Unique contact ID  
- ClientId (FK): Foreign key to Clients  
- ContactName: Name of the contact

**Relationship**: ClientContacts.ClientId â†’ Clients.ClientId  

==============================
ðŸ§ª USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================

- Always start from the Clients table (C).
- Always apply: WHERE C.IsDeleted = 0 to exclude deleted clients.
- When user provides a name like "John":
  WHERE (C.FirstName LIKE '%John%' OR C.LastName LIKE '%John%') AND C.IsDeleted = 0
- Join ClientProperties if property info is needed:
  LEFT JOIN ClientProperties CP WITH(NOLOCK) ON CP.ClientId = C.ClientId
- Join ClientContacts if contact info is needed:
  LEFT JOIN ClientContacts CT WITH(NOLOCK) ON CT.ClientId = C.ClientId

âœ… Example:
SELECT 
  C.FirstName,
  C.LastName,
  CP.PropertyName,
  CT.ContactName
FROM Clients C WITH(NOLOCK)
LEFT JOIN ClientProperties CP WITH(NOLOCK) ON CP.ClientId = C.ClientId
LEFT JOIN ClientContacts CT WITH(NOLOCK) ON CT.ClientId = C.ClientId
WHERE (C.FirstName LIKE '%Alice%' OR C.LastName LIKE '%Alice%')
  AND C.IsDeleted = 0
